### Hello! 

My name is Peter Lam and I am an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently transitioning from a career in music to tech and look forward to being able to merge the two. I was self-taught in audio engineering and music production which has helped prepare my mindset for learning new skills on this journey to becoming a software engineer.


### About Me:
ðŸ“š Enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp (August 2022 - October 2022)

ðŸŽ¹ Freelance audio engineer and music producer

ðŸ”® Hope to one day create my own VST (Virtual Studio Technology)

### What's New?
ðŸ’¡ I recently finished a project using Spotify API that allows users to search for an artist and display their discography. Each album will have their own modal which will show the album artwork, album name, and album tracklist. The discography and modal elements will be added dynamically to the html file using Javascript and jQuery.
