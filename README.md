## Hello! 

My name is Peter Lam and I am an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently transitioning from a career in music and look forward to being able to merge the two. I was self-taught in audio engineering and music production which has helped prepare my mindset for learning new skills on this journey to becoming a software engineer.


### About Me:
ðŸ“š Enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp (August 2022 - October 2022)

ðŸŽ¹ Freelance audio engineer and music producer

ðŸ”® Hope to one day create my own VST (Virtual Studio Technology)

### What's New?
ðŸ’¡ I recently finished a project using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js to design a full CRUD application inspired by 500px and Instagram. The application allows users to create, edit and delete photo albums. In addition, users can add and delete comments on individual photos.
