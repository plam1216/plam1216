## Hello! 

My name is Peter Lam and I am an aspiring software engineer. I'm currently transitioning from a career in music and look forward to being able to merge the two. I was self-taught in audio engineering and music production which has helped prepare my mindset for learning new skills on this journey to becoming a software engineer.


### About Me:
ðŸ“š Enrolled in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp (August 2022 - October 2022)

ðŸŽ¹ Freelance audio engineer and music producer

ðŸ”® Hope to one day create my own VST (Virtual Studio Technology)

### What's New?
ðŸ’¡ I recently finished a project using Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js to design a full CRUD application inspired by 500px and Instagram. The application allows users to create, edit and delete photo albums. In addition, users can add and delete comments on individual photos.

Check it out:
